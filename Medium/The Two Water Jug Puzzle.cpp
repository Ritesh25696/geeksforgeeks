You are at the side of a river. You are given a m litre jug and a n litre jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d litres of water where d < n. Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d litres of water in one of jug.
The operations you can perform are:

Empty a Jug
Fill a Jug
Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.
Input:
First line consists of T test cases. Only line of every test case consists of 3 spaced integers denoting m , n, and d respectively. 

Output:
Single line output, print the minimum number of operations.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N,D<=100
1<=M<=N

Example:
Input:
2
8 56 46
3 5 4
Output:
-1
6
